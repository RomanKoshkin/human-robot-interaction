This project explored the ability of recurrent neural networks trained on a small set of motor prim- itives to generate meaningful novel patterns with limited corrective feedback from the experimenter.

## Introduction

According to one hypothesis, complex motor behaviors are compositions of a limited set of innate and/or learned motor primitives. We attempted to test this hypothesis in a humanoid robot controlled by a recurrent neural network (RNN). Specifically, our robot was trained to grasp a target object in three different locations. If the hypothesis is true, the robot should be able grasp the target not only in the trained, but also in other locations. 

Aware that model architecture might lead to vastly different results, we explored two alternative architectures: a simpler deterministic RNN (with and without a separately trained variational autoencoder) and a more advanced variational Bayes RNN. In the Methods section below we limit our account to the most important aspects, for full details please see the code in this repo.

## Methods

We used a 16-joint humanoid robot (Torobo Humanoid, Tokyo Robotics). The models were trained on a dataset of three primitives either  representing separate sequences each or stacked along the time axis into one long trajectory. A primitive was defined as a sequence of joint angle vectors of size 16 comprising a motion trajectory. Each primitive began at the starting position, continued smoothly until the object -- a soft toy die (approx. 13 x 13 x 13 cm) lying on a white plastic surface -- was grasped, (for the deterministic model -- also lifted, put back on the table), released, and terminated back at the starting position. Complete with motor data (joint angles comprising the movement trajectory) the datasets contained temporally synchronized visual inputs (grayscale images of size 64 x 64 pixels). The training data were recorded using a separate Python script at 10 Hz as the robot's arms were moving along a trajectory of seven waypoints, while the head was fixated on the object by an independently running object detection model (YOLO v3  [[1]](#1) and [[2]](#2)). Note that with the deterministic models YOLO was only used during training, while during testing the RNN controlled all the joints (including neck). The deterministic models were were implemented in PyTorch and trained with two loss functions (for motor and visual loss). For the stochastic model we used the NRL C++ library; for details please refer to [[3]](#3) and [[4]](#4).

## Deterministic models

We used two slightly different deterministic models. The first and simpler one (Figs. 1 and 2) was trained on a dataset of three primitives each representing a separate sequence; the primitives were stacked along the time axis into one long trajectory.

However, the downside of this approach is that the model may simply learn one long trajectory and be 'reluctant' to switch/interpolate between primitives in a way that is not consistent with the order of points in the training trajectory. In other words, it is unclear whether such a model can in principle handle cases where the die is located off the spots seen during training.

Training the RNN on separate sequences seemed a reasonable next step. Our second model (Fig. 3) was trained on separate primitives. During training, initial hidden states corresponding to each trajectory were taken from the bottleneck of a separate variational autoencoder pre-trained on the same dataset. These hidden states provided low-dimensional representations of the future trajectory the RNN should generate. With only three primitives three different arbitrary hidden variables would work equally well, but with a larger number of primitives the corresponding initial hidden states should retain the relative structure of the primitives they encode.

## Stochastic model

For the stochastic model we took a different approach, in which the head was kept fixated on the target by an independent object-detection model (YOLO ¥cite{yolov3, ErikLinderNoren2020}) both during training and testing. The main control model (PV-RNN [[3]](#3)) received no direct visual input; it could only infer the position of the target based on the the angles of joints 14 and 15 (neck). Thus, despite no high-dimensional visual input, the PV-RNN was able to learn the association between the position of the object on the table and where arms should be moved next to complete the task with the least error possible. For YOLO, we used weights pre-trained on the CoCo dataset and trained them for 1000 epochs on 109 images of and corresponding bounding boxes around the target object. The bounding boxes were drawn manually using the OpenLabeling software [[5]](#5)).

## Testing

At testing, the robot's arms are set to an external force following online trajectory mode in which the robots arms move along the trajectory predicted by the model, but also respond to external forces applied by the experimenter. We hypothesized that if the model learns several attractors corresponding to a specific trajectory, it would be possible for the experimenter to encourage the robot -- by pushing and pulling at its arms -- to switch from one primitive to another and potentially generate meaningful novel motions (e.g. reaching for the target in a location not seen at training).

## Results

With the caveat that more experimenting is necessary, the deterministic RNN trained on one  dataset of three stacked trajectories performed best (see [Video 1](https://youtu.be/JDUFVfB_m2I), [Video 2](https://youtu.be/gvtrafrl8U8), [Video 3](https://youtu.be/t3FlPp70nlI), and [Video 4](https://youtu.be/Zgrf4W37GI4)). In terms of human-robot interaction, this model responded to the experimenter moving the robot's hands apart and seeminly 'tried' to grasp the target in locations between those present in the training data. Specifically, when the robot was stuck holding the target for a long time, a slight push by the experimenter was enough to help the robot go back the the starting position (arms wide open).
